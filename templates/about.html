    <p>
        tast.ie is a personal and optionally social bookmark repository inspired by early
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">del.icio.us</a>.
        it's a simple way to save, organize, and share links that matter to you or your community.
    </p>

    <p>
        this application was written in large part because <a href="https://nop.codes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i</a>
        had a few discussions about a real need for social/community bookmarks in current_year. it's self-hostable if you want, and easy to 
        deploy because communities need to be able to easily spin up infrastructure that isn't owned by a company with financial incentives.
    </p>
